// Below are events which occur during the course of simulation. Each Peer
// is responsible for issuing the appropriate event.  A simulation can have
// a collector, which listens to the event updates, perhaps calculating
// statistics or storing events to a log for post-processing.
//
// Example collectors can be found in collectors.h, but have the general
// interface:
//
// @code
//     template <class T>
//     struct Collector
//     {
//        template <class Event>
//        void
//        on(NodeID who, SimTime when, Event e);
//     };
// @endcode
//
// CollectorRef.f defines a type-erased holder for arbitrary Collectors.  If
// any new events are added, the interface there needs to be updated.
